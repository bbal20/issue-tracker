Hello,

I had a personal account using email address kitopatterson@yahoo.com. However, I am a graduate student and wanted to take advantage of the free Pro service so 
I created a new account using my school email address (kitop@mail.smu.edu). I signed out of the current account using my personal address, 
created a new account with my edu address and signed back into the Kite Copilot using the new account. However, it is saying I am using Kite Free and 
to Upgrade to Kite Pro. I don't think my school account is being recognized as such to take advantage of the Pro features. 
Is there any further direction you can provide so I can take advantage of the Kite Pro for students? Do I need to uninstall and reinstall? 
My school email is...kitop@mail.smu.edu

Thank you,
Kito Patterson
